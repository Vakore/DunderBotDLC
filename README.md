The .java files for a Minecraft bot I'm trying to work on. Meant to be an extension to baritone with jump sprinting, PvE, basic inventory management, and hopefully PvP alongside other mode advanced features like beating the game.

Some gradle files are missing in this github. This is because I have not uploaded them. Run at your own risk (that is if you can figure out how to get this code running).
